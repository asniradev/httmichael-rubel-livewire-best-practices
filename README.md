This repository is a curated list of general advisories on how to use [Livewire framework](https://github.com/livewire/livewire) to meet enterprise concerns regarding security, performance, and maintenance of Livewire components.

### Short introduction
My name is [Michael Rubel](https://github.com/michael-rubel) and I started using the Livewire framework in 2019 when it was new and barely stable. Back in the day, I was impressed with how fast dynamic UIs can be shipped without even using JavaScript. But like any software solution, it had its pitfalls, and I was forced to deal with them. The main goal of this repository is to collect the most important experiences that you need to consider when working with Livewire.

You must know that I often use Livewire as [`full-page components`](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/rendering-components#page-components), so most of the recommendations will be based on this experience.
